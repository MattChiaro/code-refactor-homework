# CODE REFACTOR HOMEWORK

## Description

The purpose of this on-the-job challenge was to refactor existing code that was not adhering to modern HTML5 semantic standards. I was able to take the existing code and replace outdated `<div>` tags and replace them with their semantic counterparts. To promote SEO and accessibility, I added image `alt` attributes and ordered my `<h1>` through `<h4>` tags to effectively structure the webpage. Additionally, I practiced DRY coding by removing redundant and repetitive CSS code and consolidating it.
